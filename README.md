I will populate this list with hundreds more book titles when I have time to transcribe all of them from my goodreads app. There are approximately 500
titles I have listed so far, and that number only represents the titles I can easily recall from memory, as a profound affinity for literature has been 
one of my defining characteristics since childhood.
